Welcome to the Unkey changelog. It's been a month since we our last changelog so lets talk about what has changed.

### Contributing Improvements

When we announced both our hiring and funding we saw an influx in people wanting to contribute to Unkey. We quickly found out, our contribution guide was hard to follow and we had some third party requirements that could be optional.

We now have a [contribution guide](https://unkey.dev/docs/contributing/getting-started) that should take less than 5 minutes to follow and allow you to contribute. If you prefer you can watch the video I made, that talks you through each area.
